# React 19 useEffect Cleanup Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to the cleanup function in React 19's `useEffect` hook.  The problem involves the incorrect specification of the dependency array, leading to unexpected behavior and potential memory leaks.  The solution highlights the importance of including all variables used within the effect in the dependency array.

## Problem

The original `bug.js` demonstrates a `useEffect` hook where the cleanup function doesn't trigger as expected because the dependency array is missing the `count` variable.  This can lead to unintended side effects, such as unnecessary operations or memory leaks, especially if the effect involves timers or subscriptions. 

## Solution

The corrected version, `bugSolution.js`, fixes the issue by adding `count` to the dependency array. This ensures that the cleanup function runs appropriately when the `count` variable changes.
